Brainstorm of features:
-Login ability (or maybe not?)
-Server or local host?

-multiple chat rooms (user in only one at a time?)
   -Personal chatroom to begin with
-Pictochat from DS
-private messages? depends on login or nah
-no pictures 
-profanity filters (how do we ban anonymous people?)
-display number of people in room
-notifications?
-run on startup??? Run in background???
-


Leaning towards anonymity.
Server is a must
